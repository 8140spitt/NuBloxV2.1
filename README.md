# NuBlox

**NuBlox** is a **SQL-agnostic, low-code application builder** and **visual database studio** — an open-source alternative to Oracle APEX that works with **any SQL dialect**.

Built with SvelteKit and designed for flexibility, NuBlox helps developers and teams rapidly model, build, and deploy applications on top of **MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite**, and more — without being locked into a single vendor.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **SQL Dialect Agnostic**  
  Generate DDL/DML for multiple SQL engines from a unified schema model.

- 🧱 **Visual Schema Builder**  
  Drag-and-drop interface for designing tables, columns, constraints, and relationships.

- 🧰 **ORM-Ready DSL**  
  Use JavaScript/TypeScript to define schemas programmatically — no third-party libraries required.

- 🔐 **Built-in Auth + Session Management**  
  Out-of-the-box user/session handling with secure password hashing and token workflows.

- 🎨 **No-Code UI Builder (Coming Soon)**  
  Define interfaces declaratively, connect them to database views, and auto-generate admin apps.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (Svelte 5)
- **Backend**: Custom logic, no 3rd-party ORMs
- **Database**: MySQL (default), multi-dialect support planned
- **Auth**: Native password + token-based authentication

## 📦 Installation

> ⚠️ NuBlox is in early development. Expect breaking changes and incomplete features.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/8140spitt/NuBloxV2.1.git
cd NuBloxV2.1
pnpm install
pnpm dev
````

Make sure your `.env` file is configured for MySQL or your preferred SQL backend.

## 📄 Example: Defining a Schema

```ts
const schema = {
  name: 'nublox',
  ifNotExists: true,
  charset: 'utf8mb4',
  collation: 'utf8mb4_general_ci',
  tables: [
    {
      name: 'users',
      ifNotExists: true,
      columns: [
        { name: 'id', type: 'INT', primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true },
        { name: 'username', type: 'VARCHAR(255)', unique: true, notNull: true },
        { name: 'email', type: 'VARCHAR(255)', unique: true, notNull: true },
        { name: 'password', type: 'VARCHAR(255)', notNull: true },
        { name: 'created_at', type: 'TIMESTAMP', defaultValue: 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP' }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

Generate SQL output from this schema with:

```ts
import { generateCreateDatabaseSQL } from '$lib/sql/DDL';

const sql = generateCreateDatabaseSQL(schema, 'mysql');
console.log(sql);
```
